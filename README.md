# broll-folder-maker

This project was created to streamline the creation of b-roll folders for Business Insider's Authorized Account and How Crime Works series. The B-Roll must be sorted into topic-specific subfolders, and those subfolders must then be sorted into chapters. Doing this in Finder was tedious.


This project allows the user to:

  First, create the episode folder.

  Second, instantly create chapter folders by entering an integer for the number of chapters.

  Third and finally, create user-named subfolders within each chapter folder.


Instructions:
  1. Open a Terminal window at the project root folder.
  2. Run "python main.py"
  3. Follow the prompts in the terminal
